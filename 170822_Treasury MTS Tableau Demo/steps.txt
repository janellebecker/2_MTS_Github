Things to Note:

***Ultimate goal: overlapping choropleths on a dashboard that respond to a dropdown menu
Show the sheet depending on the dropdown
----------------------------------------

***Just as in PPT, there are notes/captions at the bottom of each worksheet. If someone didn't edit these, Tableau's default is to tell you what was done.
Helpful for: replication & looking up details
(e.g., did you include null values?)

***Seeing the data as a spreadsheet

***Dimension vs. Measure?

***Region choro--oops no geo! mark as geo
	--using region or create from...
	--heirarchy

***Zooming/moving on map

***Name and Duplicate sheet

***Create dashboard to see both
	--start side by side

***Add in toggle
	--Can't drag paramter to filter-->
		Create calc field
	--Name calc field diff than param
	--DON'T show other map when X selected

*** Create dash with bins
	--ensure toggle works
	--hide titles
	--create dyanmic title?
